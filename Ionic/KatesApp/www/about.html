           Lizzie Milanovich is a Boston based actor, playwright, teacher, coach, loud mouth, and all-around whack job. Born and raised in North Dakota (yes: North Dakota) (no, Mount Rushmore's in the other one), she likes to think she still maintains a bit of that midwestern sunshine-y charm, but, if nothing else, she certainly maintains the dialect--&nbsp;<em>you betcha!</em></p>

           <p>Milanovich moved to Boston in 2010 to pursue a degree in Theatre Studies from Emerson College. While there, she studied under many Boston professionals in scene study, film, improvisation, dance, playwriting, performance art, dramaturgy, dialects,&nbsp;and Linklater voice, as well as engaged in rigorous academic classwork through the college's Honors Program.&nbsp;She developed a reputation as a fiery character broad with a penchant for playing middle-aged women (and is now trying to figure out her type until she reaches middle age and can return to her niche...) A campus newspaper once described her theatrical aesthetic as a combo of Zooey Deschanel, Lena Dunham, and Judy Blume (for real).&nbsp;As an undergrad, she also worked as an intern at SpeakEasy Stage Company and as a front-of-house staff member for The Huntington Theatre Company at the Boston Center for the Arts. She was employed by Emerson College as a teacher's assistant in freshman Linklater voice and advanced accents/dialects courses for one year following the completion of her bachelor's degree in 2014.</p>
           
           <p>Since graduating, Milanovich has worked with Theatre on Fire,&nbsp;Brown Box Theatre Project, Flotsam Productions,&nbsp;and Fresh Ink Theatre Company<em>&nbsp;</em>as an actor and with Fresh Ink and Shotz Boston<em>&nbsp;</em>as a writer. She has taught dialects courses at Gloucester Stage Company and Wheelock Family Theatre, as well as worked in the summer program at Walnut Hill School for the Arts.&nbsp;She has appeared in various readings throughout the city, including Boston Playwrights' Theater, Lesley University, and Northeastern University.</p>
           
           <p>Milanovich is passionate about vegan muffins, drag queens, wearing at least two patterns at a time, feminist rants, and keeping her closet as messy as possible (sorry, mom.) She once cried in a sushi restaurant because Sigourney Weaver sat behind her. Her #1 caloric intake is french fries, followed closely by bubble tea.&nbsp;She occasionally lies about what TV shows she has and has not watched. She's seen the new Ghostbusters movie 6 times and, frankly, does an amazing Kate McKinnon impression. Her hopes and dreams include: growing into a grand dame and giggling as much as possible.&nbsp;</p>
           
           <p>In 2016 she was named one of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.improper.com/life-style/25-x-25/">Boston's top 25-under-25 locals to watch by The Improper Bostonian</a>, so she plans on spending the next few years trying to live up to that terrifyingly nice information.&nbsp;</p>
